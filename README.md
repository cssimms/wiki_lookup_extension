#Wikipedia LookUp Extension

A Google Chrome extension to enable searching a selection of text on Wikipedia.

In the future I would like to publish this to the Chrome Store, but for for now follow these steps to install.

###### Installation
* Clone Repo
* Open Extensions Tab in Chrome
* Click 'Developer mode' in Top-Right
* Click 'Load unpacked extension' button in Top-Left
